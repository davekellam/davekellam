# 👋 I'm Dave Kellam

I'm a developer, designer and teacher, living in Montréal.

## About

I've been creating on the web for 30 years. WordPress has been my primary tool to do so for the last 20 or so. I've used it to create sites for newspapers, television, Fortune 500 companies, non-profits, mom & pop shops, friends, and everywhere in between. If you'd like to build something get in touch.
