# 👋 I'm Dave Kellam

I'm a developer, designer and teacher, living in Montréal.

## About

I've been creating on the web for 30 years and been using WordPress as my primary tool for the last 20 😅. I've created sites for newspapers, television, Fortune 500 companies, non-profits, mom & pop shops, friends, and everywhere in between.
